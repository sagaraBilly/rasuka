# Rasuka (Rust Kaiseki)
Rasuka is a command-line application designed to help you analyze data by generating visualizations and performing descriptive statistics. It supports generating scatter plots, bar plots, and describing data.

This is the first Rust program I made, and itâ€™s a project I created to learn and explore the Rust programming language. 
It is a work in progress, and I welcome contributions, feedback, or suggestions as I am still new in rust programming. 

# Features
Scatter Plot: Generates a scatter plot of the specified x and y columns from your dataset. <br>
Bar Plot: Generates a bar plot for visualizing the relationship between two specified parameters. <br>
Describe: Outputs descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for the specified data column. <br>

# Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:<br>
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rasuka.git```

2. Change to the project directory:<br>
```cd rasuka```

3. Build and run the application using Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system):<br>
```cargo build```

4. Run the application:<br>
```cargo run -- -p path/to/your/data.csv -x column_name_x -y column_name_y --scatter```

# Usage
Command-line Arguments
-p or --path: Path to the dataset file (CSV format).
-x or --paramx: The column name for the x-axis parameter.
-y or --paramy: The column name for the y-axis parameter.
--scatter: Generates a scatter plot of the data.
--barplot: Generates a bar plot of the data.
--describe: Outputs descriptive statistics for the specified data column.

Example usage:
```cargo run -- -p data.csv -x column_x -y column_y --scatter```

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have suggestions or improvements.<br>
Since this is my first Rust project, please go easy on me and any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
